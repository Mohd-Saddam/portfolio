    "about": [
      "I'm a passionate Python Backend Developer specializing in building scalable, high-performance APIs and microservices. With 5+ years of professional experience, I excel in developing robust backend solutions using FastAPI, Django Rest Framework, Flask, and modern cloud technologies. I am enthusiastic about writing clean, maintainable, and highly performant code that solves real-world problems.",
      "I began my journey as a software engineer in 2018, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve, taking on challenging projects across various domains including logistics, construction automation, restaurant technology, and e-commerce. I have hands-on experience with PostgreSQL (PostGIS), MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis, Docker, AWS, Azure Functions, and implementing microservices architecture.",
      "I am a progressive thinker who enjoys working on complex backend systems end to end, from requirement analysis and architecture design to implementation, optimization, and deployment. I have successfully optimized SQL queries reducing API latency by 40%, improved search response times by 90% using ElasticSearch, and implemented real-time data synchronization using Kafka.",
      "When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, learning Data Science & Machine Learning, or solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems. You can follow me on LinkedIn and GitHub to see my latest projects and contributions."
